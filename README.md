# Emotion Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python project focused on emotion classification and sentiment analysis of textual data. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize emotions expressed in textual comments. By leveraging tools such as VADER and TextBlob, this project aims to provide insights into the emotional tone of various comments.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of textual comments to classify them into different emotions. The main goals of the project are:

- To preprocess and clean the text data.
- To use sentiment analysis tools like VADER and TextBlob to determine the sentiment of comments.
- To visualize the sentiment distribution in the dataset.
- To classify emotions into categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary packages using pip and the provided `requirements.txt` file.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-classification.git
   cd emotion-classification
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download necessary NLTK resources:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named `Emotion_classify_Data.csv` which contains textual comments and their associated emotions. You can download or create a similar dataset for testing.

- **Columns:**
  - `Comment`: The text comment to be analyzed.
  - `Emotion`: The actual emotion expressed in the comment (e.g., fear, anger, joy, etc.).

## Usage

To run the project, you can execute the script provided in the repository. The script performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset from the CSV file.
2. Cleans and preprocesses the text data.
3. Analyzes the sentiment of each comment using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
4. Visualizes the sentiment distribution in the dataset.


## Sentiment Analysis Techniques

This project utilizes two main sentiment analysis techniques:

1. **VADER Sentiment Analysis:**
   - VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to analyze sentiments expressed in social media.

2. **TextBlob:**
   - TextBlob is a simple library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

## Results

After analyzing the dataset, the sentiment distribution in the comments is visualized as follows:

- Positive comments are represented in green.
- Negative comments are represented in red.
- Neutral comments are represented in grey.
